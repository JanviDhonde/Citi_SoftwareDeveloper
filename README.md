# Citi_SoftwareDeveloper
I completed the Citi ICG Technology Software Development Job Simulation, where I worked on enhancing loan management and stock market risk reporting systems. I created state diagrams, researched machine learning for credit risk assessment, and built a Java tool for real-time risk visualization, applying system design and communication skills.
